<h1>Simpson family</h1>

<p>The Simpson family are the fictional characters featured in the animated television series The Simpsons. The Simpsons
    are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three children, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.
    They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield, United States, and they were created by
    cartoonist Matt Groening, who conceived the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his own
    name. The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" and were later spun
    off into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the U.S. on December 17, 1989.

    Alongside the five main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family. The
    most commonly recurring characters are Homer's father Abraham "Grampa" Simpson; Marge's sisters Patty and Selma
    Bouvier; and the family's two pets, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. Other family members include Homer's
    mother Mona Simpson, Homer's half-brother Herbert Powell, Marge's mother Jacqueline Bouvier, and other minor
    relatives.

    Homer Jay Simpson is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons.[1]
    He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared, along with the rest of his family, in The Tracey Ullman Show
    short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was
    waiting in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks's office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts
    based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character
    after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpson family
    got their own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. The show was later acquired by Disney in 2019.

    As the nominal foreman of the paternally eponymous family, Homer and his wife Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa
    and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer
    embodies many American working class stereotypes: he is obese, immature, outspoken, aggressive, balding, lazy,
    ignorant, unprofessional, and fond of beer, junk food and watching television. However, he is fundamentally a good
    man and is staunchly protective of his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban
    blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing
    the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President George H. W. Bush, and winning a Grammy
    Award as a member of a barbershop quartet.

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Simpson">Bart Simpson</a></h2>
<img src="images/bart.jpg.png" alt="Bart.S">
<p>Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson[1] is a fictional character in the American animated television series The Simpsons
    and part of the Simpson family. He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and first appeared on television in The Tracey
    Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed Bart while waiting
    in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic
    strip, Life in Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters. While the rest of the characters were
    named after Groening's family members, Bart's name is an anagram of the word brat. After appearing on The Tracey
    Ullman Show for two years, the Simpson family received its own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. Bart
    has appeared in every Simpsons episode except "Four Great Women and a Manicure".

    At ten years old, Bart is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge, and the brother of Lisa and Maggie.
    Bart's most prominent and popular character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness and disrespect for
    authority. Hallmarks of the character include his chalkboard gags in the opening sequence; his prank calls to Moe;
    and his catchphrases "Eat my shorts", "¡Ay, caramba!", "Don't have a cow, man!", and "I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell
    are you?" However, with the exception of "¡Ay, caramba!", these hallmarks have been retired or are not often used.
    Bart has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons – including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons
    Ride, commercials, and comic books – and inspired an entire line of merchandise.

    In casting, Cartwright originally planned to audition for the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart.
    Smith's voice was considered too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. Cartwright found Lisa
    uninteresting, so she instead auditioned for Bart, which she thought was a better role.[2]

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Simpson">Lisa Simpson</a></h3>
<img src="./images/Lisa.jpg" alt="Lisa.S">
<p>Lisa Marie Simpson[1] is a fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons. She is the middle
    child and most accomplished of the Simpson family. Voiced by Yeardley Smith, Lisa was born as a character in The
    Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed her while
    waiting to meet James L. Brooks. Groening had been invited to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic Life in
    Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the older Simpson daughter after his younger
    sister Lisa Groening Bartlett. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family were
    moved to their own series on Fox, which debuted on December 17, 1989.

    Intelligent, kind and passionate about the planet and all living things, Lisa Simpson, at eight years old, is the
    second child of Homer and Marge, the younger sister of Bart, and the older sister of Maggie. Lisa's high intellect
    and left-wing political stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age; therefore she is considered
    a bit of a loner and social outcast. Lisa is a vegetarian,[2] a strong environmentalist, a feminist, and a Buddhist.
    Lisa's character develops many times over the course of the show: she becomes a vegetarian in season 7 and converts
    to Buddhism in season 13. A strong liberal and activist for peace, equality and the environment, Lisa advocates for
    a variety of political causes (e.g. standing with the Tibetan independence movement) which usually sets her against
    most of the people in Springfield. However, she can also be somewhat intolerant of opinions that differ from her
    own, often refusing to consider alternative perspectives and showing a feeling of self-righteousness. In her free
    time, Lisa enjoys many hobbies such as reading and playing the baritone saxophone, despite her father's annoyance
    regarding the latter. She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons – including video games, The Simpsons
    Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books – and inspired a line of merchandise.
